<h1>Project overview</h1>

A small app providing a simple and user
friendly solution to some of the grave
problems faced by Indian farmers through
the use of ML models, API's and several
different softwares.

<h1>Achievements</h1>

1. Successfully Trained 2 ML Models Separately for Predicting the crop and Checking for disease in one day.

2. Using API to know the current Mandi prices in the locality.

3. Integrating a ChatGPT powered AI Chat Bot for easing out the work of the farmer and also opening a new mode of learning for them.

<h1>Key Features</h1>

1. Taking down the Language Barrier between the Farmer and the App through 10 different largely spoken languages throughout India.

2. Integrating an Authentication System to keep the data confidential.

3. Adding a Help Section for bridging the communication gap between App and the Farmer.
