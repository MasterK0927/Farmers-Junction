<h1>Project overview</h1>

![Roadmap](https://github.com/MasterK0927/Farmers-Junction/assets/64908981/cd2be3e7-f22e-4a2e-81e2-6c08293d9af5)

A small app providing a simple and user
friendly solution to some of the grave
problems faced by Indian farmers through
the use of ML models, API's and several
different softwares.

<h1>Achievements</h1>

1. Successfully Trained 2 ML Models Separately for Predicting the crop and Checking for disease in one day.

2. Using API to know the current Mandi prices in the locality.

3. Integrating a ChatGPT powered AI Chat Bot for easing out the work of the farmer and also opening a new mode of learning for them.

<h1>Key Features</h1>
